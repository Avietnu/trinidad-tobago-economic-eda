# Economic Trends in Trinidad and Tobago (2001-2024)

## Project Overview
This project analyses key economic and labour market indicators in Trinidad and Tobago between 2001 and 2024. This analysis focuses primarily on GDP growth, inflation, and unemployment datasets and indicators to identify long-term trends, volatility and relationships between economic factors.

## Objective
To assist Trinidad and Tobago's local businesses understand employment and economic trends and make informed business decisions by examining how economic shocks affect output, prices and employment over time.

## Tools & Skills Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Power Query (data cleaning and transformation)
- Pivot Tables and Charts
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Trend and cross-indicator analysis

## Key Insights
- Out of the three indicators, GDP growth exhibited high volatility and reacted most rapidly to external shocks.
- Inflation displayed cyclical behaviour with delayed spikes following economic disruptions.
- Unemployment responded most gradually, which reflects lagged labour market adjustments.
- Economic shocks tend to affect output first, followed by prices, then employment.

## Repository Structure
- '/data/raw' - Original datasets sourced from the World Bank
- '/data/cleaned' - Cleaned, analysis-ready dataset
- '/reports' - Final EDA report
- '/planning' - Project scope and planning documentation

## Limitations 
This analysis is descriptive in nature and does not establish causal relationships. Data is annual and does not capture any short-term fluctuations.
